## Organizing Files
### Best Practices for File Organization:
- **Use Descriptive File Names**: Avoid generic names like "Document1" or "Untitled." Use clear, descriptive names such as `Research_Paper_Draft.docx`.
- **Create a Logical Folder Structure**: Group files into folders and subfolders based on categories like "Classes," "Projects," "Work," or "Personal."
- **Version Control**: When working on multiple versions of a file, include version numbers or dates in the file name (e.g., `Thesis_v1.docx` or `Thesis_2023_09_10.docx`).
- **Backups**: Regularly back up important files to external drives or cloud services like Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox to avoid data loss.

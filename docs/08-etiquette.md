## Email Etiquette

### Choosing the Right Email Address
- **Use Your University Email**: Always use your university-issued email for academic communication. This ensures your messages are taken seriously and helps recipients identify you as a student.
- **Avoid Casual Email Addresses**: If you use a personal email, ensure it's professional (e.g., your name). Avoid email addresses like `cooldude123@gmail.com`.

## Setting Up an Email Signature


1. **Access Settings**:
   - In the top-right corner, click the **gear icon** for settings.
   - Scroll down and click **View all Outlook settings** at the bottom of the settings pane.

2. **Finding the email signature settings**:
   - In the top-right corner, click the gear icon for settings.
   - Depending on which version of Outlook you're using, the settings might be in different places. you're looking for something that says "Email signature". It will either be in the General settings or under Compose and Reply - the simplest approach is just to search for email signature in the search settings box.

3. **Create Your Signature**:
   - In the **Email signature** box, type and format your signature. Add your name, title, contact info, and any relevant links. You can also insert images if needed.
   - As a student, I would recommend setting up a polite greeting and sign-off, your student ID, and then a list of the courses you are enrolled in.

4. **Automatically Include Signature**:
   - Under the signature box, check the boxes to **Automatically include my signature on new messages that I compose** and **Automatically include my signature on messages I forward or reply to** if you want the signature to appear in every email.

5. **Save**:
   - Click **Save** to apply your new signature.

## Best Practices for Email Signatures

- **Keep it Professional**: Use a clean design with a professional font.
- **Avoid Overloading**: Don’t clutter your signature with too many images or long text. Stick to essentials.
- **Consider Social Media Links**: If relevant, include links to your professional social media profiles (e.g., LinkedIn).
- **Compliance**: Be aware of any university or workplace email signature policies.

### Writing a Professional Email

1. **Subject Line**:
    - Be concise and clear. Your subject line should give the recipient an idea of what the email is about (e.g., **“Question Regarding PSY101 Assignment”** or **“Request for Meeting: Research Project”**).

2. **Greeting**:
    - Start with a formal salutation. For professors or staff, use their title (e.g., **“Dear Professor Smith”** or **“Hello Dr. Johnson”**). If you're unsure of the person's title, it’s better to be formal.

3. **Introduction**:
    - Introduce yourself if it’s your first time contacting the person, especially in large classes. Include your full name, course name, and section number (e.g., **“My name is John Doe, and I’m a student in your PSY101 class, section A.”**).

4. **Purpose of the Email**:
    - Get to the point quickly and clearly. State why you're writing in one or two sentences (e.g., **“I’m writing to clarify the requirements for the upcoming research assignment.”**).

5. **Details and Questions**:
    - If you have specific questions, list them clearly. If discussing multiple points, use bullet points or numbered lists to make the email easy to read.
    - Avoid long, rambling emails. Keep your message focused and clear.

6. **Polite Closing**:
    - Always end your email politely. Common closings include **“Thank you for your time,”** or **“I appreciate your help.”**
    - Follow up with a formal closing like **“Best regards,”** or **“Sincerely,”** and sign with your full name.

### Example Email:

```text
Subject: Question Regarding PSY101 Assignment

Dear Professor Smith,

My name is Jane Doe, and I’m a student in your PSY101 class, section B. I’m writing to clarify the instructions for the upcoming research assignment due on Friday. Could you please confirm whether we are required to submit an outline along with the final paper?

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
```

### Attachments:

- **Use Descriptive File Names**: When attaching files, use descriptive names (e.g., `JohnDoe_PSY101_Assignment1.pdf`).
- **Mention Attachments in the Body**: Always mention that you've attached a file (e.g., **“I’ve attached the draft of my research paper for your review.”**).
- **Check Attachments**: Before sending, double-check that you’ve attached the correct file.

## Using Microsoft Teams for University Communication

Microsoft Teams is widely used in universities for communication, collaboration, and virtual learning. Here’s how to use it professionally.

### Setting Up Your Microsoft Teams Profile
- **Use Your Full Name**: Ensure your display name is your full name as listed in your university records. This helps professors and peers identify you easily.
- **Add a Profile Picture**: Upload a clear and professional profile picture (avoid informal selfies or overly casual images).

### Teams Meetings Etiquette

1. **Join On Time**:
    - Always join meetings or classes on time, or a few minutes early. If you anticipate being late, let the host know in advance.
    - Use the **mute** button when entering to avoid disturbing the session if you're late.

2. **Mute Your Microphone**:
    - When not speaking, mute your microphone to minimize background noise. Only unmute when it’s your turn to talk or ask a question.

3. **Use Video When Appropriate**:
    - In small group discussions or one-on-one meetings, it’s polite to have your video on to foster engagement and connection. Ensure your background is tidy and non-distracting.
    - For larger lectures, follow the instructor’s guidance on whether video should be on or off.

4. **Ask Questions Politely**:
    - Use the **raise hand** feature if available or wait for an appropriate pause before speaking.
    - Alternatively, type questions in the chat box if the instructor allows it. Keep questions concise and relevant to the topic.

5. **Participate Respectfully**:
    - Actively listen to the speaker, and avoid multitasking during meetings. When participating in group discussions, ensure that your contributions are respectful and constructive.
    - Avoid interrupting others while they are speaking. If you're in a group setting, you can use phrases like **“I agree with what Sarah mentioned, and I’d like to add…”**.

6. **Leave the Meeting Properly**:
    - Wait until the meeting is fully concluded before leaving. If you must leave early, inform the host beforehand.

### Chat Etiquette in Teams

1. **Stay Professional**:
    - Microsoft Teams is not a social media platform. Keep conversations professional and focused on the task or project at hand. Avoid using excessive emojis, GIFs, or slang in academic settings.

2. **Respond Promptly**:
    - If someone asks a question or addresses you in Teams, try to respond promptly, especially in group projects. Delays can hinder group progress.
    - If you cannot respond right away, acknowledge the message and indicate when you’ll follow up.

3. **Keep Messages Brief**:
    - Be clear and concise in your messages. For longer discussions or explanations, consider setting up a quick call rather than a lengthy chat conversation.

4. **Respect Privacy**:
    - Avoid sending personal or sensitive information through Teams messages unless absolutely necessary. Always be mindful of privacy, especially in group chats.

5. **Use Mentions Thoughtfully**:
    - Use the `@mention` feature to grab someone’s attention (e.g., `@ProfessorSmith` or `@TeamName`), but don’t overuse it. Tagging everyone for minor points can clutter the conversation.

### File Sharing in Teams

1. **Organize Files Properly**:
    - When uploading documents to a Teams channel, make sure files are named appropriately and stored in the correct folder.
    - Use descriptive file names so others can easily understand what the file contains (e.g., `GroupProject_Draft_V2.pdf`).

2. **Collaborate Effectively**:
    - Teams allows for real-time collaboration on shared documents. When editing a file collaboratively, avoid making too many changes at once, and leave comments for clarity when revising someone else’s work.

### Example of a Chat Message in Teams:

```text
Hi @ProfessorSmith,

I just wanted to confirm the deadline for submitting our research proposal. Is it still due next Friday? Thank you!

Best,  
Jane
```

## Best Practices for Digital Communication

- **Be Respectful and Polite**: Whether you’re emailing a professor or chatting with classmates on Teams, always maintain a respectful and polite tone.
- **Avoid Caps Lock**: Writing in all caps can be interpreted as shouting. Use appropriate punctuation and capitalization.
- **Proofread**: Before hitting send, check your emails or messages for spelling, grammar, and clarity. Mistakes can lead to misunderstandings.
- **Manage Notifications**: Keep your notifications organized. Turn on important notifications for assignments or project discussions and disable distractions.
